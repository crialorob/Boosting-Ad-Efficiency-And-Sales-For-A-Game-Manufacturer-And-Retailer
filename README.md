### SCENARIO

I worked as a data analyst for Turtle Games, a game manufacturer and retailer. They manufacture and sell their own products, along with sourcing and selling products manufactured by other companies. Their product range includes books, board games, video games and toys. They have a global customer base and have a business objective of improving overall sales performance by utilising customer trends. In particular, Turtle Games wants to understand: 
- how customers accumulate loyalty points.
- how useful are remuneration and spending scores data.
- can social data (e.g. customer reviews) be used in marketing campaigns.
- what is the impact on sales per product.
- the reliability of the data (e.g. normal distribution, Skewness, Kurtosis).
- if there is any possible relationship(s) in sales between North America, Europe, and global sales.
